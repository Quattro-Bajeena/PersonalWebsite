### Getting the data

Python scripts that get (extract) my Activities from websites API's/RSS feeds and put them all in a database, from which those are used by a website feed.
The entires in database formated like RSS, so it can be converted to that for all my activities.

                                                -> RSS feed for my website
        web API 1 -> script  -> ↓              ↑  
        web API 2 - > script -> Database - - - - > Feed displayed on my site  
        RSS feed 1 -> script -> ↑  

Using RSS feeds (don't know if doable or free).
Or accesing those webistes APIs by Python and getting the data I want, a nice challange.
Definetly doable with Twitter and Youtube.

| Platform |    API    |     RSS   |
| :------- | :-------: | --------: |
| Twitter  |Yes        | Kinda     |
| Youtube  |Yes        | Kinda     |

|Facebook  |Proopably  |Don't know |
